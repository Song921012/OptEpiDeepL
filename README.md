# OptEpiDeepL

Codes for "Shuangshuang Yin, Jianhong Wu, Pengfei Song. (2022) Optimal epidemic control by deep learning techniques and its applications on epidemic models, Journal of Mathematical Biology."

All the source codes are in  `src` folder.

The output is in `output` folder.

To run the codes, install julia, vscode (optional but recommended), configure the development environment, and open julia repl, `] instantiate`, then you can set up the environment.

You can also run `precompile.jl` to precompile the codes, which will reduce the compiling time. (Note that I run the codes in Linux system, so if you use windows, you need to change `JuliaSysimage.so` to `JuliaSysimage.dll`)
